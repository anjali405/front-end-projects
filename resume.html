<h2>Acadamic Projects</h2>
   <h3>B. TECH – Final Semister Project</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Role : <strong>Team Leader</strong></li>
       <li> Project Title : A Rounding-Based Appropriate Multiplier For High-Speed Yet Energy-Efficient Digital Signal Processing.</li>
       <li>Description	: Consumption of Energy is the major factor, in the various processing application like DSP, ASIC, and FPGA. The motive of this work is to approximate the multiplication process.The multiplier operands are rounding off to the two power N format which is nearest to the input values. With a small penalty of error, the speed and energy considerably increased. Literature survey reveals that earlier works are based on modifying the structure or complexity reduction of a specific accurate multiplier. This multiplier leads to better error rate when compared with other multipliers. So the rounding based inexact multiplication provides high speed and energy efficient for various processors. The area, speed, and timing analysis are performed for this approach and for some existing accurate and approximate multipliers.The proposed 8-bit RoBA multiplier multiplication offers better efficiency in energy consumption when compared with other.</li>
